# Data Folder

---

This folder is to contain any data that the project may frequently use.
This could involve survey results, datasets found online, and more.

For all datasets that you include in this GitHub, please include a description 
of the dataset in this README under this "GitHub Datasets" section. Be as specific 
as you think is needed for teammates to work with the data.

If you are uploading any datasets greater than **50 MB** in size, do NOT upload 
them to this GitHub. GitHub may not allow you to do this and even if it does, it
 isn't proper etiquette. Please upload these large datasets to the OneDrive folder
 and include a link and description of the dataset in this README under the 
 "OneDrive Datasets" section.
