# Regulations for Cookie Prompting

## Types of Cookies

### Strictly Necessary Cookies

Cookies used by a website that are necessary to the function of the application. These do not collect personally identifiable information nor do they track browsing habits. These cookies can remember language preferences, settings you apply, provide security, manage your account and login process, and more.

### Non-Essential Cookies

Cookies that are not necessary for a website to function. If disabled, the website can still run smoothly and be used. These cookies can fall under third-party cookies (or tracking cookies), session cookies, or persistent cookies.

Third-party cookies are those collected by a service, website, or tool separate from the one that you are currently on. For example, if you allow non-essential cookies on Amazon when you purchase a computer, you may start to get ads for computers or computer products on other websites that have a cookie agreement with Amazon. They track your browsing habits.

Session cookies are cookies that expire once the website or browser is closed. For example, when you fill in a form on one portion of the webpage and then have to fill in a similar section later and find that the page auto-fills it, this may be because of session cookies. These cookies also indicate what server a user has connected to.

Persistent cookies last much longer than session cookies and remain on the user's device until the user deletes them or they expire. These may be used by search engines to measure website performance.

## Important Legislation

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
While this 88-page document only ever mentions cookies in one paragraph, this paragraph essentially states that since cookies can be used to identify users, they qualify as personal data and therefore are subject to all regulations about personal data outlined in the GDPR.

### EPD (ePrivacy Directive)
This directive, widely known as the "cookie law", caused the proliferation of cookie consent pop-ups on websites and supplements the GDPR, addressing crucial aspects about the confidentiality of electronic communications and the tracking of Internet users more broadly.

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
The CCPA forces businesses to be transparent about the cookies they use and how they use them. A big point in this legislation is that cookies that fall under the jurisdiction of this document are subject to "opt-out, not opt-in" policies; meaning that users must be provided a way to opt out of cookie selling and usage, but by default users are opted in for the use of these non-essential cookies. This is true unless the business has knowledge that a user is under 16 years of age, in which case the business must operate under an opt-in policy.

The CCPA applies to all businesses, servers, applications, and whatnot that operate in California whether the entity is headquartered in CA or simply performs some kind of web operations in the state or collect data from California residents.

## Cookie Consent

The **GDPR** and **EPD* require websites to ask for its users' consent to use non-essential cookies.

For consent to be valid, it must be:
- Informed: users must understand what they are agreeing to
- Freely given: users must have a genuine choice to give consent
- Specific: cookies with different purposes must have separate categories for consent
- Unambiguous: consent cannot be implied. The user must make a selection on the prompt before non-essential cookies can be collected.
- Revocable: Users must be able to withdraw consent at any time
- Demonstrable: The website must be able to provide proof of consent in the case of an audit

## Cookie Consent Exemptions

### Criterion A
If a cookie must be used to carry out any sort of data exchange over an electronic communications network (i.e., a session cookie sending a connection request to the website's servers), then informed/explicit consent is not required.

### Criterion B
If a cookie is required for a functionality explicitly requested by the user. If this type of cookie is disabled, then the functionality cannot be provided. If this type of cookie is required simply for the user to access the website, this is also an explicit "request" by the user.
