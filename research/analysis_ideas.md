# Analysis and Statistical Test Ideas

## General Analysis

- Visuals of our respondent demographics
- Relationship between main browser and average ease of cookie rejection (also potentially a statiscal comaprison?)
- Relationship between main browser and "Do you know how to stop sharing cookies..."
- Relationship between main browser and "Are you able to block all third-party cookies..."
- Do college students care about cookie data collection?
- What do college students generally do when presented with a cookie banner? (Accept, reject, etc)
- Why might a college student not use a website due to cookies?
- Do people actually know what they're giving away with cookies and understand cookie banner language?

## Statistical Tests

Erik listed a few notes in `cookie_awareness.md` with relevant statistics. I plan to compare the statistics we get about college students to those. Some ideas are:

- Compare the proportions of people who claim to have comprehensive/little/no understanding of cookies
- Compare the proportions of consent rates in the US to our population
- Isolate the Gen Z respondents by age and compare the proportion that blindly accept all cookies
- Compare proportion of people who said they understand cookies to proportion who answered correctly on banner questions

Some tests can come by comparing groups in our dataset to each other:

- Do STEM majors claim to have a greater understanding of cookies/reject them/care more than non-STEM majors?
  - Could compare the proportions that selected "Yes, fully" or "I understand the basics" on the 2nd question.
  - Could compare the means for level of ease to reject cookies as well
  - Compare the proportions that selected "Rarely" or "Never" accept all cookies
- Do STEM majors ACTUALLY have a greater understanding of cookies?
  - Compare the proportion that got the correct answer on some of our banner-specific questions.
