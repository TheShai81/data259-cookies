The study compared two common types of cookie notices, binary-choice (accept all or update preferences) and category-choice (displaying all cookie categories on one screen).

The experiment revealed that the binary-choice notice achieved a slightly higher overall opt-in rate for all cookies compared to the category-choice notice. This effect was even more pronounced on mobile devices, where users were most likely to accept all cookies when presented with a binary-choice notice.

However, the follow-up survey indicated that users' preferences differed from the observed opt-in rates. More than half of the respondents (53.5%) preferred the category-choice cookie notice. Their reasons for this preference included:
- Better overview and transparency of the cookies being used.
- The ability to make all decisions on the first level of the notice without requiring additional clicks.
- A perception of greater trustworthiness due to the transparent presentation of cookie options.


Respondents who preferred the binary-choice notice (37%) cited:
- Easier navigation.
- Faster selection due to its perceived simplicity.
- The perception of the notice being clearer with only two initial choices.


The study also identified several external factors that influence users' decisions when presented with cookie notices. The most frequently mentioned factors were:
- Simplicity of use of the cookie notice, which had a generally positive effect on user attitudes.
- The speed with which the cookie notice could be dismissed, also generally having a positive effect.
- Time pressure when surfing, which had a predominantly negative effect on users' attitudes.


Despite the higher opt-in rate for binary-choice notices, the preference for category-choice notices suggests that users value transparency and control.

The study also found that the majority of respondents found cookie notices annoying (87.9%) and often clicked the most prominent button to dismiss them quickly. Interestingly, over half of the respondents associated the presence of a cookie notice with the credibility or trustworthiness of the website (58.5%).


***while simplifying the cookie notice and making it easy to dismiss might increase opt-in rates, website operators should also consider that overly complicated notices with "digital nudges" could further annoy users and that cookie notice variants that make users feel like they do not have control over their choices undermine user trust.***

*They suggest making all possible choices visible on the first layer of the cookie notice.*
